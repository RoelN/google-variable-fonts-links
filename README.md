# Google Variable Fonts Links

This is a sophisticated high-tech tool to construct links to the full variable fonts available on Google Fonts.

## Why?

Because Google Fonts does not yet disclose all axes in their web interface. So you have to hand-craft the correct URL to get a font with all the axes, which takes an amount of brainpower currently simply not available to mankind.

## How to run

Keep putting one leg in front of the other really fast. Haha! Anyway, how to run _the script:_

```bash
$ node getGFCSS.js
```

This will output the links to the CSS files for each font as a simple key/value set.
